<p>AS A manager at an internet retail company<br>

WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file<br>
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize<br>
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands<br>
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data<br>
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application<br>
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database<br>
